## About

- Data tables for a fictional commercial building.
- Part 2 continuing on from the "Basic-SQL-Table" project
- Divided the main script into different scripts with suitable naming conventions
- Added a "Tenant" table as a junction table for the "Floor" and "Company" tables. This made the data easier to read and to work with. Also, now a floor can have multiple companies.
- Created using MariaDB, DBeaver and SQL.
