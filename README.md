# Basic-SQL-Tables-2 (in progress)

<img src="Office Building ER Diagram.png"/>
 
- I wanted to make tables for a fictional commercial building.
- In the attached script the user can create the tables for the floors and the companies (the tenants).
- The user can also insert, update and delete items/rows.
- Created using MariaDB, DBeaver and SQL.
